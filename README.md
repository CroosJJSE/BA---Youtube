### CATWOE Analysis
- **C**lients: Who benefits from the system?
- **A**ctors: Who implements the process?
- **T**ransformation Process: What is changing?
- **W**orldview: What is the bigger picture?
- **O**wners: Who has control?
- **E**nvironmental Constraints: External limitations.

**Case Study Example:**
- **Scenario:** Implementing a new CRM system.
- **Conflict:** Stakeholders have differing views on priorities.
- **Resolution:** Use CATWOE to identify key players and align requirements.

## Additional Tips
- During brainstorming sessions, be prepared to mediate conflicts between stakeholders.
- Always provide clear and accurate data to IT teams to support decision-making.

- **Must Have**: Vital requirements/features that cannot be avoided.
- **Should Have**: Significant tasks but not critical to project success.
- **Could Have**: Nice to have but not mandatory.
- **Won't Have**: Not required at the moment.

---

## Use Case Modeling
- Defining requirements using UML diagrams.  
  **Note**: You need to learn this.

### UML Diagram

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
### Waterfall Model
- Sequential process:
  1. BA gathers requirements → BRD, FRD, SRS.
  2. Development → 1 month.
  3. Testing (QA/SIT) → 1 month.
  4. UAT → 2 weeks.
  5. Production → Go Live.
  
**Metaphor**: Delivering the entire house after 5 months without client involvement.

---

### Agile Model
- Iterative process with 4-week sprints:
  - Create **User Stories** (see below).
  - Frequent feedback from clients.

**Metaphor**: Delivering a house room-by-room with constant client feedback.

#### Agile vs. Waterfall in SDLC
![alt text](img/image-10.png)

- **Waterfall**: BRD, FRD, SRS, RTM, SIT Test Plan, UAT Test Plan, Lessons Learned Document.
- **Agile**: User Stories, Sprint Planning, Retrospective Document, JIRA/Confluence tools.

---

## User Stories
![alt text](img/image-11.png)

- **Definition**: Informal explanation of a software feature from the end user's perspective.
- **Format**: 
  > "As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]."

#### Components:
- **Story Point**: Time estimate for development.
- **Sub-task**: Smaller units within a story.

### Epics vs. User Stories vs. Tasks
- **Epics**: Large, complex collections of user stories.
- **User Stories**: Business requirements from the end-user perspective.
- **Tasks**: Smallest units, breaking down user stories further.

---

## Practical Advice
- Record calls to create user stories immediately.
- BA performs **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**:
  - If defects occur, they are logged in JIRA for resolution.

---

## Agile Roles & Responsibilities
- **Analyzing Business Processes**: Identify areas needing improvement.
- **Proposing Solutions**: Develop actionable strategies.
- **Creating User Stories/Tasks**: Prioritize user needs.
- **Stakeholder Management**: Balance requirements and resolve conflicts.
- **Sustainable Development**: Promote collaboration and adaptability.

---

## Agile Manifesto
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### Principles
- Deliver value continuously and early.
