must have
    very vital requirement/ features
    there is no avoiding them
    
should have
    these tasks are significant but not critical to the project success 
 
could have
    nice to have but not mendatory

wont have
    no need actually

SDLC- software development Life cycle
1. waterfall
    BA takes all requirement - make BRD FRD SRS
    development - 1 month
    Testing QA - SIT - 1 month
    UAT - 2 weeks
    PROD - go live ....
    this is a traditional method of going one way like water, no going back

2. agile
    Sprint time ( do a mini waterfall ) within 4 weeks
    ![alt text](image-9.png)
    creating user stories ( what is user stories please explain )


waterfall is like delevering the entire house after 5 months where you wont have any idea about it until you see it ( so this method is dying )
agile is like first builder complete one room, you check and give feedback, then within 3 weeks he complete another room. like wise the clint(business owners) will be walking with the team4
## agile vs waterfall in sdlc
![alt text](image-10.png)

Waterfall - BRD, FRD, SRS , RTM , SIT Test Plan, UATTest Plan ,Lessons learned Document .

agile - user stories (if a single user story is bigger for an agile circle, we will break into two user stories)

A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user.
 After reading a user story, the team knows why they are building, what they're building, and what value it creates. 
 User stories are one of the core components of an agile program. They help provide a user-focused framework for daily work — which drives collaboration, creativity, and a better product overall.

 for internal we dont need BRD instead we use JIRA
 User Stories , Diagrams, print Planning Document, Sprint retrospective document ,
Tools required for documentation — JIRA , CONFLUENCE
Al tools for creating BRD.



what are the requirements needed to be collected from a business owner in a meeting as a BA
in next call , we will draw process flow diagram we will get feedback from customer. they will review it and correct it.
after confirmation, we can proceed with development
next -  
    User Stories , epics , user stories
    Estimation of user stories
    Budgeting for every user story — funding is approved
    unit testing SIT UAT
    Change control process (explain about this)

user story has
    story point - how long the developer take time to develeop
    sub task

practical advice,
record the call and make the user stories asap because you will forget



Test Plan
BA is not required to do test, BA does UAT ( user acceptance testing)
UAT will be tested with customers
if any thing fails it called defects , they will put the JIRA.
we have to fix all defects

## learn about the domain

I.What are the roles & responsibilities of an Agile Business Analyst ?
Explain with examples ?
Analyzing Business Processes: Examining current processes and areas needing
enhancement.
Identifying Improvements & Proposing Solutions : Determining key areas where changes can
improve performance and results. Develop actionable strategies to address identified issues
and optimize processes.
Analyzing the Data: Agile Business Analysts often use data analysis to identify trends, patterns,
and Insights that can inform decision-making and help craft effective strategies
Creating user stories , tasks & defects : Agile Business Analysts focus on understanding user
needs and preferences.
Negotiation and Stakeholder Management: Skillfully negotiating and balancing the needs
and requirements of various stakeholders .
Resolving Conflicts: Need to understand the reason for conflicts and taking necessary steps .

2. What is Agile Manifesto ? Explain in
detail?
O
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
O
Working software over comprehensive documentation
O
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
o
Responding to change over following a plan


Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
We follow these brinciples:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.
Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work
•ogether daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.
Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

4.What is a User Story? How to write a user story ?
A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the
end user or customer.
As a [personal, I [want to], [so that]."
![alt text](image-14.png)

5. How are user stories, epics, and tasks different?
User Stories: They provide the team with simple explanations of the business' requirements
created from the end user's perspective.
Epics: An epic is a collection of related user stories. They are usually large and complex.
Tasks: Tasks are used to break down user stories further. They're the smallest unit in Scrum
that is used to track work. A person or a team of two people usually work on a task.

6. What is Sprint? How long is each Sprint ?
A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to
1
complete a set amount of work.
Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies, and
getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with
fewer headaches.


24. How do you handle conflicts or disagreements within an Agile team?
Stick together
Believe in each other
Acknowledge experience, expertise, and individual skill sets
Make room for different persvaalities
Look for ways to help
Support and respect
